YouTube continues to be the most popular [social media service](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshay-singh-04a25a241/) in 2024, with more than 2 billion users logging in. The growth can primarily be attributed to the rise of digital platforms. 
However, a question that often arises is: Is YouTube a social media platform? While some might argue that Youtube is just a video platform, it is much more than that and in many respects, it qualifies to be a social network.

In this post, we will consider YouTube as social media and focus on its functions, features and how it connects people, businesses and brands.
## What is Social Media?
Now before we can properly discuss whether Youtube can be considered a social media platform, let’s first define what social media is. Social media consists of systems that allow users to create, receive, and exchange content, build communities, and contact other users. This broad abbreviation includes such activities as posting, commenting, liking, sharing, and following accounts or channels.

Social networks can be referred to through Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook as examples but rarely do people notice that YouTube acts in a similar way. It’s a very social platform that allows users to build communities together virtually. Let’s look closely at this criterion that YouTube conforms to.

## Creation and Posting of Videos
A significant aspect of social media is how content creation and sharing takes place. Through [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@sachibate1), users are enabled to post videos. By this, we can notice that content is being created for the consumption of billions. As with other social sites, content on YouTube is diverse including personal videos, tutorials, entertainment, and educational content as well.
What is more, creators can update their audience with new uploads thus promoting communication as well. Is YouTube a social network? Worry not, as long as one understands its function as a social network in this case but not a social networking site. The users of YouTube can easily create and upload videos the same way users of Facebook create posts or Instagram users post photos and stories.

## Engagement via Comments, Likes and Shares
One of the features of social media is the interaction of users. YouTube prompts engagement through community comments, likes as well as shares. Comment sections allow viewers to ask questions or reach out to the creator of the content.

This allows for the establishment of a two-way communication channel between the content creators and their audiences. For instance, many YouTubers spend considerable time answering their audience’s comments to create a devoted subscriber base.
Additionally, users can further disseminate the videos, like, and dislike them, which increases the social aspect of the interaction. This interaction is what defines YouTube as a social media as it shapes a social relationship around the uploaded content.

## Community Building and Following
Another important feature of the social network is the possibility to create communities and follow other people. In YouTube, this is done through subscriptions. When users subscribe to a channel, they show interest in the content produced by the creator and wish to receive an alert when the creator posts a new video. This is quite the same case as following an account on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook.

YouTube for business allows people and organizations to create a community of followers who have the same interests in the videos created by a particular author. From beauty tutorials to fitness trainers and tech reviews, these communities tend to interact via the comment section, hence creating an avenue for engagement and friendship. So, Yes, YouTube is a social network because it creates a feeling of connection among users.

## Social Media Prefers to be Safe
YouTube is a video-sharing platform, however, unlike the others, it does not allow users to share all of its content portably. The videos of Youtubers can be distributed through social media, messaging, or emails. Their YouTube friends and followers act socially by sharing this information through social media.
Furthermore, you can find videos on YouTube mostly because its recommendation system suggests some to you, which is in turn controlled by your liking activities on the app. This characteristic is also why YouTube is considered a social media, as it is built on social engagement, exploration, and sharing of videos.

### A New Approach to Interacting with Followers
One of the latest and most entertaining parts of social media marketing is live streaming. Letting content creators go live on YouTube in real time enables the audience to interact with them almost instantly. So people can comment on something in real-time, ask questions, or participate, which is, rather, the point of social media interaction.
Live streaming offers a unique route for creators to engage with their followers. For example, some can do live Q&As, live sessions with viewers or stream when the event is taking place. This helps to make relations with viewers even stronger and improves the community's activity, allowing YouTube indeed be called a social media platform.

## Influence and Social Impact
One of the main points about social media is its ability to affect people’s lives, their opinions, and even their choices. YouTube has become a stronghold of influencers, brands, and businesses and their audiences. Famous YouTubers have a powerful say, endorse and partner with various brands, thereby raking in millions of dollars. It is a perfect example of how influential YouTube is to trends, marketing and consumer behaviours.
YouTube advertising seems to be and is in practice, a similar platform for the influencers and the businesses as other social networks in that they create the trends, make the first moves and sell the products. YouTube is social media because it is dominant in how people share and access information, thus giving people who influence and those who create the content control over a large audience.

## Customization and Social Connection
Social networks and YouTube share a key element; ‘customization and engagement’. The system enables audience member`s homepages to view a video that correlates with their interests and what they have watched before. After a video, by liking, commenting, and subscribing to channels, users determine what videos get forwarded to them. The connection and reliance on the platform also strengthen the evidence that YouTube is a social media site.

Also, when using this platform, YouTube’s algorithm increases the chance of social interaction due to videos recommended to the user, that have a lot of comments, likes and shares. This content recommendation system makes users more active within the platform, posting, sharing, and engaging with their subscribers, followers, and other communities.
Conclusion: Could it be said that YouTube is a form of Social Media?

For the question, “Is YouTube social media?” one may answer with a yes. YouTube is social media because it enables users to create, upload, or share content as well as interact within the built communities, two of the defining characteristics of social networks. Starting from uploading the video, including live streams that allow real-time conversation and commenting; etc., which characterize social media, YouTube has it all.

YouTube is continuously developing; thus, the boundaries of sharing videos and social networking will probably overlap even more, strengthening its status as one of the most important social networks in the globe.
